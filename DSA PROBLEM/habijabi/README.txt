How to execute junit tests:
-Replace the assigncontroll.java file in your codebase. MUST CHANGE THE DATA PATH INSIDE BOTH Assigncontroll.java and Alltest.java 
 depending on your local machine where the sample data is located.
-install eclipse IDE (if u dont have already)
-open IDE. from file->import->existing project as workspace - select Assign25Framework folder.
-open Alltest.java inside the IDE. Right click on it ->run as -> junit test. you should see all tests tick mark on the left side of the screen now.



in cas u wanna compile from terminal (not recommended here):
    javac -d bin -sourcepath src src/code/AssignControl.java
    java -cp bin code.AssignControl
